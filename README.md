Overwatch Discord Bot (10000H)

This is a self-initiated project using Node.js to create a Discord bot that integrates the video game, Overwatch, with the Discord chat platform. The bot retrieves a user’s
Overwatch statistics and is capable of displaying the user’s statistics, managing server roles based on user ratings and verifying the Overwatch profile belongs to the Discord
user.
